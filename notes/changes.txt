[Promotions Slider]
- Updated `PromotionsSlider` to use real data from `ProductsCubit`.
- Logic: Skip first 12 products (used in New Arrivals & Recommended) to ensure uniqueness.
- UI: Implemented `Row` layout containing:
    - Left: Column with Brand, Title, Description, and "Buy Now" button.
    - Right: Product Image with Hero animation.
- Discount Logic: Uses `discountPercentage`. If 0, defaults to 5% OFF.
- Navigation: Clicking card or button navigates to `ProductDetailsPage`.
