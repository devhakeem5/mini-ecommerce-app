Flutter Coding Challenge — Mini Commerce App
Deadline: Friday, 11:00 PM
This challenge evaluates Flutter architecture, performance, UX quality, and problem-solving.
Focus on clean code, fast UI, and correct data handling, not feature overload.

What You Are Building
A small product browsing + cart Flutter app using a real dummy API, closely matching the provided design reference.
The app must demonstrate:
Clean Architecture
Fast browsing
Offline-aware behavior
Proper data structures (cart, search, caching)
Ability to clearly explain your code and decisions

Mandatory Screens (REQUIRED)
These 3 screens are mandatory. Matching the reference design closely is highly recommended.
1) Home / Browse (REQUIRED)
Product list (grid or list)
Product image, name, price
Pagination (infinite scroll or load-more)
Loading & empty states
Cached data should appear instantly if available
2) Product Details (REQUIRED)
Large product image
Product name, price, rating (if available)
Variant / option selector (simplified is fine)
“Add to Cart” action
Smooth navigation animation (Hero/shared element preferred)
3) Cart (REQUIRED)
List of cart items
Quantity increase / decrease
Remove item
Subtotal & total calculation
Cart state must persist across app restarts

Optional Screens (choose 1–2 only)
Checkout
Profile / Settings (theme toggle, language toggle)

Data Source (REQUIRED)
Consume a dummy products API (document which one you use):
Recommended: https://dummyjson.com/products
Supports pagination, search, categories

Core Problems You MUST Solve
1) Offline-First Browse (Lite) — REQUIRED
Cache product list pages locally
If the user opens the app offline:
Show cached products
Display a subtle offline indicator
Do not block UI waiting for network
2) Cart Persistence — REQUIRED
Cart must be saved locally
Cart survives app restart and offline mode
Quantity and totals must remain correct
3) Fast Search UX — REQUIRED
Search must be debounced (300–500ms)
Avoid unnecessary API calls
Cached results should appear immediately when possible
Handle empty results and API errors gracefully

Technical Requirements
Architecture (REQUIRED)
Clean Architecture:
presentation / domain / data
Repository pattern
Dependency Injection
Clear separation of concerns
State Management
Bloc/Cubit or Riverpod
(Choose one and structure it properly)
Local Storage
drift, isar, or hive
Performance & UX
Pagination
Skeleton loaders
Image caching
Avoid unnecessary widget rebuilds
Animations (REQUIRED)
Product → Details transition
Add-to-cart micro interaction (simple but meaningful)

Edge Cases to Handle (REQUIRED)
No internet connection
Empty product list
API failure
Duplicate cart items
Quantity cannot go below 1
App restart with existing cart

Bonus (NOT REQUIRED, but appreciated)
Unit tests (especially cart logic)
Widget test for one critical flow
Documentation:
PRD
SRS
Architecture document
Sequence diagram (e.g., Add to Cart flow)

Deliverables
Flutter project
Public repository URL
Short screen recording (max 3 minutes) showing:
App flow
Code architecture (folders, state management, data flow)

Review & Follow-Up
We will review:
Architecture quality
Performance decisions
Data modeling (cart, caching, search)
UX polish
Code readability
